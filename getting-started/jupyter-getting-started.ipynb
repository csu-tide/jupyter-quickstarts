    "### 🟠 Project Jupyter\n",
    "<a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Jupyter</a> is an open-source project and set of popular tools used in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning(ML). Jupyter started out as IPython (Interactive Python), thus the file extension of .ipynb, but eventually gained support for more languages. Jupyter's name comes from 3 of the popular languages in data science: Julia, Python and R. It is also a play on the spelling of the planet Jupiter, thus inspiring our astronautical theme for this intro. Jupiter happens to be the largest planet in our solar system, and so the name Jupyter draws the parallel to the large amounts of data used in training AI/ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, if you've been following along, then you are simulaneously using three Jupyter tools:\n",
    "- Jupyter Hub\n",
    "- Jupyter Lab\n",
    "- Jupyer Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Hub enables multiple users to share a server for their notebooks. Jupyter Lab is the modern graphical user interface (GUI) allowing you to interact with your notebooks, files, programs and even a linux terminal. Jupyter Notebooks are where the magic really happens (no really, we'll get to some magic later on) allowing you to take notes, run code and display data anlyses all in one place."

    "### 💲 The Value of Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are valuable because they make coding and data analysis approachable with an interactive GUI, they eliminate the need to install several tools, and they enable collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you are a student learning to code for the first time, an experienced data scientist or a researcher training AI/ML models, you will benefit from the rich interactivity of Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks allow you to take rich notes; write, execute, and debug code; and display data and reports -- all from one web-based application. Let's consider for a moment what software you would need to replace Jupyter Notebooks. You would need a notetaking app like Microsoft OneNote, Google Docs or Evernote. You would also need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, JetBrains or PyCharm. You would also need tools to interact with and analyze data such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Minitab. At a minimum you would need to install and maintain 3 software tools, not to mention you would need to keep your work in sync across them all and need to constantly context switch between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the interactivity and consolidation of several tools, Jupyter Notebooks make it easy to collaborate with colleagues and teammates. All you need to do is share your notebook with them and they can instantly read your notes, run your code and interpret your analyses."
