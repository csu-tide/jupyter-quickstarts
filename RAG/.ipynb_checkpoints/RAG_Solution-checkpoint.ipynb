      "1. **SSH (Secure Shell)**: You can connect to your allocated node(s) using SSH and then run commands to check resource availability. For example, you might use `uname -a` to get detailed system information, or `free -h` to see memory usage, among other commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Resource Management System (RMS)**: Most supercomputers have a Resource Management System like Slurm, LSF, or Torque. These systems allow you to submit jobs for processing and monitor their status. To check resource availability in such a system, you can use commands like `squeue` to see currently running jobs, pending jobs, and resource usage.\n",

      "3. **Monitoring Tools**: Some supercomputers have monitoring tools that provide real-time or historical data about the system's performance and resource utilization. Examples include Ganglia, Nagios, or OpenNebula. The exact commands to use will depend on the specific monitoring tool being used.\n",
      "\n",
