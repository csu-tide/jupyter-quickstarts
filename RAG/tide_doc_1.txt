TIDE Wave
Technology Infrastructure for Data Exploration (TIDE)
TIDE is an advanced infrastructure platform integrated into the National Research Platform Nautilus hyper-cluster. It provides a robust environment for data exploration and computational tasks, leveraging cutting-edge technology to support artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science projects.

Using TIDE
JupyterHub
JupyterHub is a web-based interface provided by TIDE that allows users to access a range of computational resources and software tools. Here’s how to get started:

Access:

Web Interface: JupyterHub is accessible from any web browser, providing a user-friendly interface for managing and running computational notebooks.
Features:

Pre-Configured Containers: Users can choose from a variety of pre-built software containers that include packages and tools commonly used in AI, ML, and data science.
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs): Resources include options for GPUs, which are essential for high-performance computing tasks.
Getting Started:

Request Access: Complete the TIDE Support Request form to obtain access to the JupyterHub instance.
Quickstart Guide: Review the Quickstart guide available on the TIDE GitHub documentation site to familiarize yourself with the platform’s features and usage.
Software Containers: Explore the list of available software container images. For any queries or additional needs, submit a TIDE Support Request.
Launch Server: Use your campus credentials to access the TIDE JupyterHub and launch your computational environment.
Jobs
For tasks that require extended computation time or more complex configurations, TIDE allows the execution of containers as jobs within namespaces. Here’s how you can manage these jobs:

Purpose:

Long-Running Tasks: Execute long-running or resource-intensive jobs using containers.
Namespaces:

Organization: Namespaces help in organizing users, jobs, and other resources within the TIDE environment.
Assistance:

Support: If you need help with creating or managing namespaces, submit a TIDE Support Request, and the team will assist you in setting up the necessary configurations.
